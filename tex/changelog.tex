\chapter{Changelog}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Switched the two figures in fig 3.14 to correspond with the later figures. Also corrected the text.
  \item Added text to figures in fig 3.16 using overpic.
  \item Chapter on X-ray principles inserted. There might be adjustments needed. Diffuse reflection section could be taken out (Now out 14/3). Maybe a reference to master thesis?
  \item Section on multilab software moved to appendix. Might need adjustments. There should be a reference in the multilab chapter.
  \item Included side view illustrations of CAST coating recipes along with a table.
  \item Increased size of two first figures in CAST chapter.
  \item Changed amount of SPOs in summary and resume seactions.
  \item Changed caption formatting to differentiate from regular text.
  \item Increased size of fig. 3.15 (ruined sample). Added more description to the caption.
  \item Plot of pulsed-DC sputtered samples measured with XRR redone to be more clear.
  \item Long term stab. plots increased font size and added description on plots.
  \item Removed the first half page of the paper in app. D. Original paper published under Creative Commons license and can therefore be reprinted in the thesis.
  \item Added more text about the Primakoff effect.
\end{itemize}

\section{Pending changes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Figure texts lacking.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Athena stuff}
\begin{itemize}

	\item \st{ Athena production section. Show real values.}
	\item Athena baseline explanation earlier in the chapter. Why Ir/B4C?
	\item Stress study. Hard to see connection. Why?


	\item Why do we reflect in X-ray? (What's interesting to see?)
	\item Section on Athena qualifications, too much inside knowledge, why ISO for instance?\\
         - Bulletpoints with reasons?

	\item Explanation on cable length
	\item Conclusions lacking on pulsed-DC etc.
	\item Picture of broken sample unclear.
	\item Need figure of measurement positions at BESSY
	\item Athena prod. Why witness samples?

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Introduction stuff}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Effective area. Show somewhere.
  \item First figure in introduction. Too much stuff.
  \item NuSTAR mirror figure.

%    \end{asy}
%  \end{figure}


\end{itemize}


\subsection{CAST stuff}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \st{ Show coating parameters.}
      - Need pressure parameters?
  \item \st {Primakoff effect need explanation.}
  \item Section on Micromegas.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{IAXO stuff}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \st{ Remove journal paper and write into the chapter instead?}
  \item Make sure the chapter makes sense in connection with the paper in appendix D.
