\chapter{Changelog}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Switched the two figures in fig 3.14 to correspond with the later figures. Also corrected the text.
  \item Added text to figures in fig 3.16 using overpic.
  \item Chapter on X-ray principles inserted. There might be adjustments needed. Diffuse reflection section could be taken out (Now out 14/3). Maybe a reference to master thesis?
  \item Section on multilab software moved to appendix. Might need adjustments. There should be a reference in the multilab chapter.
  \item Included side view illustrations of CAST coating recipes along with a table.
  \item Increased size of two first figures in CAST chapter.
  \item Changed amount of SPOs in summary and resume seactions.
  \item Changed caption formatting to differentiate from regular text.
  \item Increased size of fig. 3.15 (ruined sample). Added more description to the caption.
  \item Plot of pulsed-DC sputtered samples measured with XRR redone to be more clear.
  \item Long term stab. plots increased font size and added description on plots.
  \item Removed the first half page of the paper in app. D. Original paper published under Creative Commons license and can therefore be reprinted in the thesis.
  \item Added more text about the Primakoff effect.
  \item Increased image sizes to 8 cm in sections 3-3.1
  \item Moved subsections on Ir/B4C further up in Athena telescope section.
  \item Changed headline of section 3.2 to reflect it being about film stress.
  \item Added to paragraph of stress the results that stress can have in thin films.
  \item New subsection for Cr roughness investigation.
  \item Added diagram of NuSTAR glass dimensions
  \item Added illustration of NuSTAR optic.
  \item Changed roughness symbol in introduction to $\sigma$ from $\theta$.
  \item Added astrophysical motivation for Athena mission in the beginning of the Athena chapter.
  \item Added some details on ISO tests.
  \item Added subsection describing effective area to introduction.
  \item The first mention of effective area in Athena chapter refers to description in introduction.
  \item Described why witness samples are needed for Athena production.
  \item Changed description of arc-occurance in pulsed-DC section. Increased figure size.
  \item Added description of MicroMegas detector in CAST chapter.
  \item Added roughness values from fit of figure \ref{fig:ir-b4c-fit}
  \item Added diagram of measurement positions on SPO from BESSY (fig \ref{fig:spo_bessy}).
  \item Most element abbreviations (B$_4$C, W etc) exchanged for the full name in the Athena chapter to make it easier to read.
  \item Changed first plot of introduction to be simpler.
  \item Added the classic depth graded ML with polychromatic beam figure.
  \item Added a short introduction to section 3.2.

  \item Various corrections on spelling and coherence throughout the thesis.

\section{Pending changes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Figure texts lacking.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Athena stuff}
\begin{itemize}

	\item \st{ Athena production section. Show real values.}
	\item \st{Athena baseline explanation earlier in the chapter. Why Ir/B4C?}
	\item Stress study. Hard to see connection. Why?\\
      -Sæt beskrivelse af stress påvirkning af data ind i introduktionen til sektionen for at lægge op til hvad kapitlet vil handle om.
	\item \st{Why do we reflect in X-ray? (What's interesting to see?)}\\

	\item \st{Section on Athena qualifications, too much inside knowledge, why ISO for instance?}\\

	\item \st{Explanation on cable length}
      %-It has been mentioned at several SPIE conferences that the cable length could be a problem and could induce cathodic arcing and influence the coating quality. No references to written documentation was provided at the time, and this should therefore not be...
	\item Conclusions lacking on pulsed-DC etc.
	\item \st{Picture of broken sample unclear.}
	\item \st{Need figure of measurement positions at BESSY}
	\item \st{Athena prod. Why witness samples?}
  \item Need paragraph to introduce Ir/B$_4$C section.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Introduction stuff}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \st{Effective area. Show somewhere.}
  \item First figure in introduction. Too much stuff.\\
      -Ikke grafer og plots i introduktionen. Introduktionen outliner problemet og beskriver hvordan problemet vil blive forsøgt løst. (populærvidenskabeligt med lidt krymmel på toppen)
  \item \st{NuSTAR mirror figure.}\\
      -Needs fig. text and reference.

%      draw(arc((-0.5,-0.01), r=0.8, angle1=-120, angle2=-60));
%    \end{asy}
%  \end{figure}


\end{itemize}


\subsection{CAST stuff}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \st{ Show coating parameters.}
      %- Need pressure parameters?
  \item \st{Primakoff effect need explanation.}
  \item \st{Section on Micromegas.}
      %-In this thesis the focus is on the optics part of both the Athena and the Cast project. The theory, issues, and scientific background for the design of the detector and other features of the two projects will not be treated. I have in this work made use of a few select constants related to the two detectors, that being the quantum efficiency used in the optimisation of the coatings and the focal length, i.e. the length between the optics module and the detector module.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{IAXO stuff}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \st{ Remove journal paper and write into the chapter instead?}
  \item \st {Make sure the chapter makes sense in connection with the paper in appendix D.}
\end{itemize}
