\chapter{Preface}
This thesis was prepared at DTU Space,
the Technical University of Denmark in partial fulfilment of the
requirements for acquiring the Ph.D.\ degree.

The thesis deals with characterising and qualifying reflective X-ray coatings for the European Athena large X-ray telescope; the design, optimisation, production and installation of an X-ray telescope on the CAST helioscope at CERN; and the design and optimisation of X-ray telescopes for the International AXion Observatory.

The thesis consists of four chapters describing each of the projects worked on in the period 2011--2014. In the appendix is found three SPIE proceeding papers and a journal paper that describes the Athena, CAST and IAXO projects.

Chapter \ref{chap:coating_facility} describes the coating facility at DTU Space and the work done to replace the control software with a more flexible and capable solution.
