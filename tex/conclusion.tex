\chapter{!!!!!!Conclusion and outlook}
In this thesis I have described investigations into grazing angle type X-ray optics for astrophysics and astroparticle physics, in particular I have during the PhD study worked with the following:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Developed new software to control the coating chamber at DTU Space.
  \item Characterised and qualified coatings for the European ATHENA mission.
  \item Investigated production facility requirements to coat flight substrates for ATHENA.
  \item Designed, produced and installed an X-ray telescope for the CAST helioscope at CERN.
  \item Designed X-ray telescopes for the proposed International AXion Observatory.
\end{enumerate}

In the first chapter of the thesis I have described the coating facility at DTU Space and the former software solution used to control the multilayer coating deposition process for the past decade. A number of features were missing in the old software, such as continuous logging and customisation options. A new software solution was produced using the SPEC package to address the missing features. At the time of writing, the software has been controlling the chamber for $\sim$1 year and been capable of producing complicated NuSTAR-like coatings as well as several coatings in a single run while varying e.g. power supply pulse frequency or chamber pressure. A continuous log of chamber pressure and power supply output is updated every 5 seconds and kept on the computer. A webpage has been set up to show plots of pressure and power output for the preceding three days and is accessible from any internet-connected computer.

Investigations into baseline and optimised coatings for the ATHENA mission led to a characterisation of B$_4$C-based multilayer material combinations Pt/B$_4$C, Ir/B$_4$C and W/B$_4$C. Long term storage investigations showed instabilities in Pt/B$_4$C and W/B$_4$C at ambient conditions, where interdiffusion and reaction to humidity changed the multilayer structure over time. Ir/B$_4$C baseline and optimised multilayer coatings showed complete stability in the qualification tests.
